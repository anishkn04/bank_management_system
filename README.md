## Working:
  1. Login (Everything)
  2. Create (Everything)
  3. Staff (Everything)
  4. Contact Us (It's literally nothing in there)
  5. Exit
  
## Currently Working on:
  1. Deleting an account through Staff
 
## Plans:
  1. Password encrypted before being saved
  2. Using .bin instead of .txt
  3. Reducing the lines
  4. Seperating the code into multiple files
